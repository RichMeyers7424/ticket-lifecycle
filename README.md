</p>
<p>
First we must go to http://localhost/osTicket/ and open a new ticket.
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
Now  we will choose a help topic, create whatever summary and description that you'd like, and then create the ticket. Here we will create a ticket for a mobile bankinng issue, something with a high severity level.
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
Now login to osTicket with an admin and go to the Agent Panel.
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
Now set the SLA to SEV-B and assign the ticket to an agent or the admin user.
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
Respond to the ticket with any response you'd like and determine if the ticket should remain open or resolved if you fixed the issue. Keep practicing, making up/creating tickets and working through them as many times as you want!
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
Here we have made mulitple tickets, but the all will need to be reviewed by an admin to set the severity level and assign an agent.
</p>
<br />

<p>

</p>
<p>
Now we have set the levels and assigned an agent to the ticket. This is a good idea of how it would apear out in the wild.
